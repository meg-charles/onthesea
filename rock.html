    <p>you clench your jaw and brace yourself. your eyes have
      finally adjusted to the darkness, but not enough to steer
      away from dangerous rocks at a moments notice. still,
      you cannot stay out in these thrashing waters. you aren't
      about to be buried at sea before your adventure can 
      truly begin.</p>
    <p>as you steer the ship in the direction of the rock, one
      of your fellow crewmates comes up to you, panicked.</p>
    <p>"what do you think you're doing," roberts yells over the noise.</p>
    <p>you  manage to yell 'captain' and 'hurt' and she understands.
      she turns from you and starts climbing up to the crows nest.
      for a normal crewmate, it would be nearly impossible to hear
      her over all this noise. but in the months you've been at sea together,
      you've heard her yell. you'll be able to hear her.</p>
    <p>as you steer, roberts guides you. apparently there aren't as
      many rocks before your destination as you assumed there
      would be. it's nice, but the closer you get, you know
      it will-</p>
    <p>"TO STARBOARD!"
    <p> you jerk your arms that way and the boat leans with your
      effort. your heart jumps to your throat, blood crashing 
      through your ears like the waters holding your life in her hands.</p>
    <p>the beginnings of the rock crags pierced the water and your
      eyes widened in alarm. somehow you managed to keep some
      semblance of calm and turned the boat into the ridge you
      had spotted from the open ocean. it turned into a deeper
      cave.</p>
    <p>what light you had been able to use disappeared as the
      rock formations swallowed you. you could hear you other
      crewmates coming out from below the deck where you yourself
      had woken not even thirty minutes before. the oiled torches
      sputtered in the breeze from somewhere deeper than  you
      could see.</p>
    <p>you order a crewmate to drop anchor and went to explain
      your situation to those who were awake.</p>
