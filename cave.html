    <p>you put your vote in to stay in the cave. As the crew
      mumbles plans to do something, you go to check on captain
      bradshaw. he looks like he's sleeping peacefully, a bandage
      wrapped securely around his wound.</p>
    <p>doctor williams assures you that he'll make a full recovery
      and reminds you not to get too comfortable in your leadership
      position and you assure her you're reluctant to take up
      the mantle in the absence of such a great captain. she hums
      noncommittally and you recall the gossip from roberts a
      week or so ago that captain bradshaw and doctor williams
      had a certain kind of tension with each other for quite some
      time. they'd started the crew together. the tenderness
      with which doctor williams looks at the man laid out carefully
      on her examination table confirms more than spoken word even
      could.</p>
    <p>you leave the good doctor to her watch and return deck side.
      the crewmembers have gathered torches and sacks. they appear
      to be getting ready for an adventure of some kind. some
      crewmembers are still in their night clothes, so you assume
      they aren't going.</p>
    <p>"permission to explore the caves, captain," thomas asks.</p>
    <p>you scoff.</p>
    <p>"i haven't earned the title, but go ahead. try not straying
      too far. we'll want to leave for the island as soon as this 
      storm lets up."</p>
    <p>the group seems to hesitate.</p>
    <p>"well go on then," you say.</p>
    <p>"are you not coming with us?"</p>
    <p>oh. you hadnt assumed the invitation extended to you.</p>
