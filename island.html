    <p>you steered the ship through the storm, the water bucking the
      vessel out of the water every beat of your heart.the rain lashes
      your face, clothes stuck to your skin as you squinted through
      the storm.</p>
    <p>roberts guides you through the water. your arms burn from
      the effort of turning the wheel. occasionally your hands
      slip from the wood, but you clench your fingers hard
      and hold on for dear life.</p>
    <p>"LARGE FORM ON PORT SIDE!"</p>
    <p>groaning wood alerts you to the shift of the large vessel.
      several tentacles worm their way into the air before
      crashing down on the deck. the wood splinters and water
      immediately rushes through the openings. the screaming
      made your ears ring.</p>
    <p>"what do we do, captain?"</p>
    <p>as if you knew! you weren't prepared for an attack. you
      didn't think the kraken even existed. but then again, here
      it is! attacking the only place you had called home.</p>
    <p>"defend the ship with your lives! we're not going down
      from the likes of this beast!" you yelled, surprised at
      your own voice washing over the crew and the gurgling
      of the beast attached to the ship.</p>
    <p>your crew shouted as bravely as they could and took
      up their swords and other weapons. you grabbed a sword
      from the mount above the doorway of the captain's cabin
      and bared your teeth. it was time to fight.</p>
