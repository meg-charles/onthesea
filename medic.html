    <p>you kick the door open to doctor williams' cabin and she
      understandably startles awake. it seems she's about to lecture
      you when she sees you have captain bradshaw in your arms.</p>
    <p>immediately she clears off a side table with a sweep of her arm as
      you walk down the stairs with captain bradshaw. the smashing of glass
      barely registers in your ears.</p>
    <p>doctor williams immediately spreads a salve from a jar on
      the wound and goes about tearing gauze and other such items
      to patch up the wound.</p>
    <p>"how long was he out there wounded?"</p>
    <p>"i don't know, doctor."</p>
    <p>doctor williams makes a distressed noise in the back of her throat,
      but continues on with her care. a moment passes and she suddenly
      stops and glares at you.</p>
    <p>"well, go take the wheel if nobody else on this bloody ship can!"</p>
    <p>her fury is enough to throw your body up the stairs to the deck and to
      the wheel.</p>
    <a href="steer.html"> take the wheel, sailor.</a>
