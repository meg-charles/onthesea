    <p>the crashing of the waves against the hull of the ship wakes you
      from your slumber.</p>
    <p>it's pitch black down in the hold and the rocking makes you
      queasy. there is a mustiness seeping into your nostrils that escaped you
      while you were unconcious. your linen shirt rustles uncomfortably over your
      skin, too hot even as you lay beneath the deck.</p>
    <p>you feel as if you could go back to sleep, but it sounds
      like it's storming pretty bad out there. as you contemplate,
      you feel your mouth go dry. there's just something about laying
      still for hours on end that makes a person thirsty.</p>
    <p>you can either go outside and risk the storm or roll over
      and fall back asleep.</p>
    <p>what will you do?</p>
    <a href="outside.html">go outside?</a>
