    <p>after making sure everything will remain peaceful on
      the ship while you're gone, you jump ship onto the rocky
      land of the cave the ship had landed at. the crew allows
      you to move to the front, though you hardly feel you
      deserve the right. you have no idea where to go.</p>
    <p>"so, have we been spelunking before or are we all going
      in blind?"</p>
    <p>your question sends a ripple through the crowd and thomas
      steps forward, along with some other crewmembers you
      haven't had the chance to get to know yet. they gather
      around you, but kept the lead to you and thus begins your
      adventure into the cave.</p>
    <p>the first few minutes you're walking, the crew chattering
      about the storm and potential repairs of the ship that will
      need to be done. as you go further into the cave and deeper
      down, the talking quiets. you can feel the crew becoming
      steadily uneasy and you're inclined to feel the same.</p>
    <p>after months at sea, you're used to the sway of the water
      and the constant breeze that keeps the air flowing around you.
      having this stillness, this quiet, unnerves you. it should
      be a relief, but it isn't.</p>
    <p>thomas expresses his unease within the cave and you agree
      with him.</p>
    <p>"captain, i think we should take it easy. we have all
      been shaken by the storm and captain bradshaw."</p>
    <p>a wet, squelching noise followed by a ear-piercing
      screech made your bones turn to liquid. the crew lurched
      and pushed you forward more in their attempt to escape
      whatever it may be that made that noise.</p>
    <p>there is a fork in the path in front of you. you can
      still command the crew if you turn one way or the other.
      which way will you turn?</p>

      obscured with black stones that slopes up</a></p>
