    <p>the beasts tentacles are flailing wildly enough that
      you could catch yourself on one and begin hacking off
      the appendages one by one. or, maybe if you cut one,
      the sharks would come and finish it off.</p>
    <p>you watch, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike.
      the shouts of your crewmates around you, fighting to defend
      their home made your courage build up in you and you caught
      sight of one tentacle that was slower than the others. it
      lagged behind and had trouble latching onto anything.</p>
    <p>before you can talk yourself out of it, you launch yourself
      off the boat and slice into the tentacle not even a quarter
      of the way down. the kraken barely notices as you latch
      yourself onto the flailing appendage and begin wedging the
      tip of your sword between the scales of the beast to cut
      it down at the source.</p>
    <p>the kraken flails once more, and you are flung up into
      the air, landing miraculously on its head. your breath
      is knocked from your lungs, but you don't have the luxury
      to recover. you roll and pitch your sword into the
      kraken's soft craniun.</p>
    <p>it has the effect you want. the beast spasms and you
      are nearly thrown from the beast again, but you hold tight
      to the sword, your right arm wrenching out of its socket.</p>
    <p>
