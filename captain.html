    <p>you rush to captain bradshaw as quickly as you can. as you brush
      a hand over his forehead, he lets out a groan of pain.</p>
    <p>concealed behind the hair on his brow is a gash about the
      length of your palm. you have no idea if it's shallow or not.
      you're not a doctor.</p>
    <p>the doctor! of course!</p>
    <p>you throw caution to the wind and heave your captain
      onto your shoulder. the doctor said something about not
      moving the injured, but you have no time to get her and come back.</p>
    <p>doctor williams will forgive you in this time of emergency.</p>
    <p>going back down the stairs in the harsh wind and lashing
      rain with the added weight is a challenge. you almost slip
      a few times, but don't out of sheer luck.</p>
    <p>the doctor's cabin is across the deck, so you make your
      way as quick as possible without jolting captain bradshaw.</p>
