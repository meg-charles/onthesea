    <p>opening the door to the main deck, you see the wooden floors ahead
      swollen with water that has flowed in from the sea. the
      deck is usually like this, but this seems serious.</p>
    <p>you turn to your right and rush up the stairs leading
      to the raised stern. captain bradshaw is nowhere to be found as
      your eyes scan the surroundings. as your eyes finally adjust,
      you see him laying facedown on the deck. whether from ale
      consumption or stray storm debris, you don't know.</p>
    <p>what you do know is you have to do something. the ship has
      no captain in the middle of what could be a deadly storm.</p>
    <p>what's your plan of action, sailor?</p>
