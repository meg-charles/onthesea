    <p>as your hands land on the wheel, you look to the horizon.
      the waves roil angrily as far as your eyes will reach.
      the wheel is slick under your hands.</p>
    <p>to the right, a craggy mountain stabs up from the sea.
      you're just a crewmember, but even you know that is not
      the correct choice to make. even with the possible danger,
      you see a small indent in the mountain that might shelter
      the ship from the storm.</p>
    <p>to the left is an island. this appears to be the intended
      destination of the ship. apparently it had bountiful riches
      buried in some cave hidden in the center of it. the shore
      looks calm and white against the tumultuous blue. but it
      is much further than the rock and you don't know if the ship
      will be able to hold long enough.</p>
    <p>so, where will you go?</p>
    <p><a href="rock.html">the rock will have to do</a></p>
    <p><a href="island.html">we came all this way. the island</a></p>
