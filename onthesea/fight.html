    <p>first things first, you trek to the port side to see just
      what this beast looks like and how you could possibly kill
      it. you have to vault over boards protruding from the floor
      and dodge tentacles as the kraken has now taken hold of your
      ship. anger fills your chest as you look the beast in its wild
      eye. you can only see one.</p>
    <p>you stand on the edge of the beam of wood and overlook
      the object of your anger. this beast will ruin months at
      sea for a quick meal that will not amount to anything.
      the size of the creature versus the size of your crew is
      next to nothing.</p>
    <p>the beast lets out a loud gurgling roar from beneath
      the surface of the water. it shakes the boat and you wobble,
      but do not fall.</p>
    <p>do it, captain! do it for us!</p>
    <p>easy for roberts to say, she wasn't about to sacrifice herself
      for the ship. tightening your grip on the sword, you strategized
      on your plan of attack. should you go for the eye, the tentacles,
      or the mouth?</p>
    <p>better to live one day as a lion, right, captain?</p>
