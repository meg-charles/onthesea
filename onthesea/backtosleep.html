    <p>the effort of trying to stay awake is too much for you.</p>
    <p>it's been a very long day on the ship and you've certainly
      earned the right to sleep in your own cot.</p>
    <p>who cares about a stupid storm, right?</p>
    <p>yeah.</p>
    <br>
    <p>you pull your threadbare blanket back over your shoulders
      and try and lull yourself back to sleep.</p>
    <p>the slap of the water against the boat doesn't ease your mind.
      in fact, it only accelerates your spiral into overthinking
      about everything that could be wrong with the ship.</p>
    <p>you toss and turn a few times, falling slowly into a restless
      sleep with nightmares plaguing you. they vary on horror to horror.</p>
    <p>the ship has a leak and the underbelly slowly fills with water, taking
      you and the rest of the crew with it.</p>
    <p>the storm capsizes the ship and everyone dies.</p>
    <p>a giant sea monster comes up from the darkest, deepest depths
      of the ocean, curling its tentacles around the hull and squeezing
      until the entire ship, cargo, and crew are nothing more than
      some splinters.</p>
    <p>fun stuff, right?</p>
    <br>
    <p>perhaps you can convince the cook on the opposite side of the
      ship to ladle you out some water. she did always like you the best.</p>
    <p>heaving yourself out of bed proves to be difficult. the rocking
      of the ship is so bad, you nearly topple back into your cot behind you.</p>
    <p>slowly, you make your way up the rickety stairs and push open the door.</p>
