    <p>you joined this crew to be a team. you won't fight alone.
      it would be dangerous and idiotic to fight the beast outside
      of the boat, no matter how much it's decimating the outside.</p>
    <p>instead, you shout for the cannon formations. your crew snaps
      to attention and scrambles through the ruins of the deck to
      follow your orders. they know what to do. captain bradshaw
      trained all of you well. just yesterday you were the one
      manning those cannons.</p>
    <p>"captain, on your orders," roberts yells.</p>
    <p>your heart beats your ribs, the pressure suddenly on you to
      do the right thing. the noise of the ship and crew goes silent
      and it is just you there, staring down the beast that would
      ruin your livelyhood if you gave it the chance. you would not
      let that happen. not today.</p>
    <p>"FIRE THE CANNONS NOW!"</p>
    <p>the booming of the cannons makes your ears ring, but you watch
      with satisfaction as the beast tries to dodge the projectiles.
      it is too slow, and gets hit by many of them. this makes the
      beast angry, but with its wounds, it let out one final tortured
      screech and dives under the water. your crew goes to celebrate,
      but you hold up your hand.</p>
    <p>"it could still come back. we should move from this place."</p>
    <p>the crew agrees, and as quietly as possible, you make your
      way to your inital destination.</p>
