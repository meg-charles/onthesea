    <p>if you squint down the tunnel, you can see the slightest
      blue color emanating from it. it puts you at ease, but not
      enough to follow it without caution completely. you draw your 
      sword from its sheath. it's not the most impressive blade, 
      having been stolen from the market just before you boarded
      captain bradshaw's ship. but it offers you some comfort, and 
      the smallest sense of protection. the others behind you do the 
      same and you're relieved more that the others don't find you to 
      be a coward.</p>
    <p>"we're going to the left, everyone. follow close and keep your 
      eyes open for any danger."</p>
    <p>that sickening squelch from before rears its head once more and 
      the crew is eager to get moving if the pressure against your back 
      is anything to go by. roberts is closest to you, and her fingers 
      brush the sleeve of your shirt. her shuddering breaths cannot be 
      disguised in the dark, but she soldiers on like everyone else. you 
      suppose that if she had to be your first mate, you could not have 
      chosen a better partner.</p>
    <p>your calves burn as you adjust your walk to avoid slipping on the 
      downward slope of the tunnel. some of the crew behind you scrapes 
      against the rocks, but you know you'd be in the same position if you 
      weren't at the front with everyone watching you. though you consider 
      the crew to be your family, they are exceedingly tough on anyone and 
      everyone. if you mess up, no mercy would be shown. it was like having 
      fifteen or so siblings watch your every move.</p>
    <p>as you continue to lead your fellow crew members through the tunnel, 
      and as you do, the rock walls surrounding your party glow brighter and 
      brighter blue. you studied before becoming a pirate, so you know this is 
      most likely due to bioluminescence within the soil and the rocks themselves. 
      some of the crew behind you murmured about magic and witches, which caused 
      quite the stir among everyone else. pirates, as you have learned the past few 
      months, are one of the most superstitious groups of people you've ever met.</p>
    <p>"everyone," you call out, sounding more confident than you felt on the inside. 
      roberts' hand on your arm was turning your legs to marmalade. "there is nothing 
      to fear. if we stick together, anything that might come at us will be outnumbered.</p>
    <p>pirate pride is a stubborn and solid thing, so the crew calms down. it's only a 
      little while further that the tunnel widens again and you feel you can breathe 
      easier. roberts lets go of your arm, and the absence of her touch leaves you 
      shivering. in front of you, the mouth of the tunnel gapes hungrily and further 
      along is more of the blue light, along with purple and green. it shimmers along 
      the walls of the tunnel like the fish you'd seen in the tropical waters a mere 
      few weeks ago. the crew behind you urges you forward with their eagerness.</p>
    <p>it is an easy task to step into the grotto, for it beckons you forward with
      promises of its beauty.</p>
