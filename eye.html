    <p>the beast stills long enough that you believe you can aim
      for its eye if you jump off the ship just right. you grip
      your sword by the hilt and jump.</p>
    <p>as you fall through the air, you realize that you are
      an idiot. what pirate would willingly jump into the sea
      to fight a monster that could be fought better by the
      weapons achored to the ship. you can hear your fellow
      crewmates shouting for you as you fall towards the beast.</p>
    <p>it somehow hasn't seen you, and you decide to try your
      reckless idea anyway. sword held out in straightened arms, you
      hurtle towards the monster's eye. you see the moment it locks
      its sight on you. the whites of the eye emerge from its
      giant black eye and the tip of your sword slices easily through
      the vulnerable spot. you smell the rot of deep sea as your
      weapon slides through the eye of the kraken.</p>
    <p>the kraken bellows and you can hear it release the ship
      behind you. you let out a whoop of victory, which turns quickly
      into a shout of terror as now the kraken has focused solely on
      you. or, more specifically, getting you off of it. without
      letting go of your sword, you dodge a tentale swung in your
      direction. you aren't so lucky with the next one, and you
      feel your leg snap.</p>
    <p>roberts shouts and gestures for you to jump. there's a
      small chance you'll actually make it but if it means you
      survive, you might want to take it. or, you could do the hero
      move and kill yourself to save everyone else. your crewmates
      would tell your story and you would be remembered by them
      and their future families.</p>
