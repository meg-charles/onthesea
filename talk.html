    <p>you head down onto the deck, watching as your friends
      gather in front of you. their expressions ranged from
      confused to angry to mildly frightened. you didn't become
      a crewmember of one of the most notorious pirate captains
      if you showed your fear so plainly. even so, you understood
      their emotions.</p>
    <p>you started with the captain, mentioning his head wound
      and that doctor williams was doing all she could to help.
      the doctor herself emerged from her place below deck. you
      gestured to her to speak.</p>
    <p>"the captain is fine. his head wound was not deep. he
      should recover without much difficulty."</p>
    <p>a sigh circled the deck. you called everyone's attention
      again. explaining your reasoning for steering the ship
      into the rock was easier than you imagined, especially
      after the ordeal you had just dealt with.</p>
    <p>"well what do we do now," your bunkmate asks. he's a
      grumpy fellow, with the wildest beard you ever could imagine.
      when you boarded the ship together, he insisted on taking
      the top bunk and you were too frightened to say no.</p>
    <p>"thank you for asking, thomas. we have a few options.
      since we're still on captain bradshaw's ship, we'll go
      by his rules. we put our options to a vote. we can either
      stay here in this cave until the storm blows over, or
      we can head towards the island we've been searching months
      for. roberts saw it from the crow's nest."</p>
    <p>A murmur went up in the crowd. Clearly these options would
      tempt the crew in both ways. You ask who is in favor of what,
      and it comes to a tie. Only you haven't put in your vote.</p>
    <p>It's all up to you, sailor. Stay in the cave or sail off
      to the island where there is certain to be riches beyond
      your wildest dreams?</p>
