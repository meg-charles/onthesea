    <p>"i should stay and ensure that we beging the repairs.
      you tire yourselves out but don't go too far, alright?"</p>
    <p>thomas nods and takes control of the group and they
      quickly leave your sight. you can still hear them shuffling
      through the cave.</p>
    <p>true to your word, you turn your eyes to the boat and
      look for the damages that would have occured in the
      violent storm after captain bradshaw was injured. there
      are some gouges in the wood of the bow that definitely
      trailed down to the hull. hopefully these could be seen
      from the inside.</p>
    <p>the gaff sail near the captain's quarters is ripped, as
      is foresail. that would take some time to repair if you
      wanted to get anywhere in the morning. other than those
      things, the ship is relatively unharmed, which you consider
      a success.</p>
    <p>you're tempted to go back to bed, your adrenaline finally
      dissipating from your body. however, something in the cave
      makes you uneasy. it's too quiet, too covered.
      you're used to the wind and sounds of the ocean. despite
      the fact that you're not far from the opening of the cave,
      you can't hear the rush of water hitting the rocks.</p>
    <p>"maybe i should have gone with them," you mutter to
      yourself.</p>
    <p>you don't dwell on that for long, choosing instead to
      do inventory of the ship's stores. your course was for
      the island, but afterwards, you were planning to travel
      to a nearby pirate trading post for a restock on supplies.</p>
    <p>there's a limited supply of oranges, your most frequent
      supply that needed restocking. hardtack was also on the
      downward.</p>
    <p>this is what you were hired on the ship to do in the first
      place. categorize and keep stock. it seemed an easy job,
      but a lot of the crew was angry with you when you first
      arrived because it meant they could no longer sneak extra
      rations from the store because you were now counting them.
      that was why captain bradshaw had hired you in the first place.</p>
    <p>a scratching sound from outside the ship made you jump,
      a product of the previous events. you'd never be so jumpy
      around the crew if they were here. thinking it was a mouse,
      you tried to go back to your work. its only when a loud bang
      from the same place happens that you get irritated.</p>
    <p>it would be just like thomas to pretend to take the crew away
      when really he was just trying to spook you.</p>
    <p>you stomp up to the deck and throw your head over the
      starboard side. your mouth runs dry, insult stuck to your tongue
      as you catch sight of what is truly on the ground by the ship.</p>
    <p>a four legged creature, covered in a slimey looking substance,
      growls up at you with row upon row of teeth in its abnormally
      large mouth. it looks like a dog, or like its trying to be a dog,
      with squat legs and a barrel torso. it looks mean and dangerous.
      what made it more frightening than a regular dog was the fact
      that its back legs are higher than its front legs, making
      it tilt down, even as it growled up at you. smoke rolled
      off its back and rippled with every growl that emerged from it.</p>
